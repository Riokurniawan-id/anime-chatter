# **App Name**: AniChatter

## Core Features:

- Character Selection: Home screen allows users to select an anime character to chat with from a curated list.
- AI-Powered Chat: Use the Gemini API as a tool to generate contextually appropriate responses based on the selected character's personality and background. If the context is missing from the user query, then supply an appropriate and common substitute.
- Chat Interface: Display messages in a clean, visually appealing chat interface. Separate styling to differentiate user and AI messages.
- Loading State: Clear loading indicators when fetching responses from the AI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A084CA) to evoke a sense of whimsy and approachability, characteristic of anime aesthetics.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F0F5). This provides a clean backdrop that does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: Gentle pink (#E29587) for interactive elements, creating a visually harmonious and engaging experience.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts optimized for readability on digital screens. Consider slightly rounded fonts to enhance the playful and approachable vibe.
- Use relevant and recognizable icons for indicating loading states. A simple, animated progress indicator would be appropriate.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, focusing on readability and ease of use. Utilize clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the application.
- Subtle transitions and animations can enhance the user experience. For example, a gentle fade-in effect when displaying new chat messages.
